## AI GENERATED IMAGE DETECTION

With the rise of generative AI, fake identities can be easily created using sophisticated algorithms. This has led to an increase in identity fraud, as fake identities can be used to gain access to online services and commit fraudulent activities. Thus, the purpose is to contribute to the development of more secure and reliable online services for everyone.

## MULTILINGUAL PRODUCT RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

Modelling customer shopping intentions is crucial for e-commerce stores, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. With this intention, we aim to utilize the ‘Multilingual Shopping Session Dataset’, a dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish.

## STABLE DIFFUSION - IMAGE TO PROMPT

The popularity of text-to-image models has spurned an entire new field of prompt engineering. Part art and part unsettled science, ML practitioners and researchers are rapidly grappling with understanding the relationships between prompts and the images they generate and in this project we aim to reverse the typical direction of a generative text-to-image model: instead of generating an image from a text prompt, can you create a model which can predict the text prompt given a generated image?

## IMAGE MATCHING - RECONSTRUCT 3D SCENES FROM 2D

Your best camera may just be the phone in your pocket. You might take a snap of a landmark, then share it with friends. By itself, that photo is two-dimensional and only includes the perspective of your shooting location. Of course, many people may have taken photos of that same landmark. If we were able to combine all of our photos, we may be able to create a more complete, three-dimensional view of any given thing and this is what we aim in this project.
Our objective is building a 3D model of a scene given an unstructured collection of images taken around it.
