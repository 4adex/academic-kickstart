The Basic and Advanced for the new semester begins. We have some really exciting topics lined up to be discussed. With the current pandemic, all the discussions will be online. Just as always, two discussions(Basic and Advanced) will be held every week. We are looking forward to new faces joining in the open discussions. You can also view the discussion schedule and other resources [here](https://vlgiitr.github.io/discussions/).
