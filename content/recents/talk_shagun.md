The core members of the group had a very informative talk and discussion with our alumnus, Shagun Sodhani ([Profile](https://shagunsodhani.com/)). He is currently a research engineer at FAIR and was one of the co-founders of ACM, IIT Roorkee Chapter. He shared experiences of his undergrad years, and also some of the crucial advice to our current members.
