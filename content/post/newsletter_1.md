Winters bring a lot of free time for you to catch up with amazing stuff. The Vision and Language Group will be posting learning resources on a weekly basis, comprising both interesting reads and talks on future research areas.

Following are a few things you'll find interesting:
1. LSTM vs Transformer: An Honest paper by Smerity: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11423.pdf
2. Teaching page of Shervine Amidi, Graduate Student at Stanford University: https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/stanford.edu
3. True Artificial Intelligence will change everything | Juergen Schmidhuber: https://youtu.be/-Y7PLaxXUrs
4. Self-training with Noisy Student improves ImageNet classification: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252
5. Self-supervised Representation Learning:
