abstract = "Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a challenging problem requiring an agent to infer a sequence of actions to achieve a goal environment state from complex language and visual inputs. We propose a generalised Language Guided Meta-Controller (LMC) for better language grounding in the large action space of the embodied agent. We additionally propose an auxiliary reasoning loss to improve the ‘conceptual grounding’ of the agent. Our empirical validation shows that our approach outperforms strong baselines on the Execution from Dialogue History (EDH) benchmark from the TEACh benchmark."
