The Vision and Language Group, part of the ACM IIT Roorkee Chapter, is a student run group which aims to foster a research-centric Deep Learning community at IIT Roorkee.

We come together once a week to discuss research papers published in the latest Deep Learning conferences. Besides this, we work on research projects aiming to publish in top research conferences.

Follow us on Facebook or Twitter to receive updates about our activities. Also, drop us an email if you would like to collaborate!
