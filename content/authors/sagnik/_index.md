### Biography

Hi! I am an ECE undergrad with my primary areas of interest being mathematics, DSA and Deep Learning, with a special fascination towards Computer Vision and its applications. Spend my free time mostly listening to music, watching some TV show or simply engaging myself in day-long movie marathons. Always up for an interesting conversation on absolutely anything, and anytime :)
