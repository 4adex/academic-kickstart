This study addresses the challenge of machine unlearning in light of growing privacy regulations and the need for adaptable AI systems. We present a novel approach, PruneLoRA where we leverage LoRA to selectively modify a subset of the pruned model’s parameters, thereby reducing the computational cost, memory requirements and improving the model’s ability to retain performance on the remaining classes
